  <title>Errata and Security Advisories</title>

  <para>The software used to create an LFS system is constantly being updated
  and enhanced. Security warnings and bug fixes may become available after
  the LFS book has been released. To check whether the package versions or
  instructions in this release of LFS need any modifications&mdash;to repair
  security vulnerabilities or to fix other bugs&mdash;please visit
  <ulink url="&errata;"/>
  before proceeding with your build. You should note any
  changes shown and apply them to the relevant sections of the book as you
  build the LFS system.</para>

  <para>In addition, the Linux From Scratch editors maintain a list of security
  vulnerabilities discovered <emphasis>after</emphasis> a book has been released. To read the list, please visit
  <ulink url="&secadv;"/> before proceeding with your build. You should apply
  the changes suggested by the advisories to the relevant sections of the
  book as you build the LFS system.  And, if you will use the LFS system as
  a real desktop or server system, you should continue to consult the
  advisories and fix any security vulnerabilities, even when the LFS system
  has been completely constructed.</para>
