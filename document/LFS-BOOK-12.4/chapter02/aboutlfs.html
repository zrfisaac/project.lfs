      Umask
    </h1>
    <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
      <p>
        Throughout this book, the environment variable <code class=
        "envar">LFS</code> will be used several times. You should ensure that
        this variable is always defined throughout the LFS build process. It
        should be set to the name of the directory where you will be building
        your LFS system - we will use <code class="filename">/mnt/lfs</code>
        as an example, but you may choose any directory name you want. If you
        are building LFS on a separate partition, this directory will be the
        mount point for the partition. Choose a directory location and set
        the variable with the following command:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">export LFS=<em class=
      "replaceable"><code>/mnt/lfs</code></em></kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Having this variable set is beneficial in that commands such as
        <span class="command"><strong>mkdir -v $LFS/tools</strong></span> can
        be typed literally. The shell will automatically replace <span class=
        "quote">“<span class="quote">$LFS</span>”</span> with <span class=
        "quote">“<span class="quote">/mnt/lfs</span>”</span> (or whatever
        value the variable was set to) when it processes the command line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now set the file mode creation mask (umask) to <code class=
        "literal">022</code> in case the host distro uses a different
        default:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">umask 022</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Setting the umask to 022 ensures that newly created files and
        directories are only writable by their owner, but are readable and
        searchable (only for directories) by anyone (assuming default modes
        are used by the <a class="ulink" href=
        "https://man.archlinux.org/man/open.2">open(2)</a> system call, new
        files will end up with permission mode 644 and directories with mode
        755). An overly-permissive default can leave security holes in the
        LFS system, and an overly-restrictive default can cause strange
        issues building or using the LFS system.

        <h3>
          Caution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Do not forget to check that <code class="envar">LFS</code> is set
          and the umask is set to <code class="literal">022</code> whenever
          you leave and reenter the current working environment (such as when
          doing a <span class="command"><strong>su</strong></span> to
          <code class="systemitem">root</code> or another user). Check that
          the <code class="envar">LFS</code> variable is set up properly
          with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">echo $LFS</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          Make sure the output shows the path to your LFS system's build
          location, which is <code class="filename">/mnt/lfs</code> if the
          provided example was followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check that the umask is set up properly with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">umask</kbd></pre>
        <p>
          The output may be <code class="computeroutput">0022</code> or
          <code class="computeroutput">022</code> (the number of leading
          zeros depends on the host distro).
        </p>
        <p>
          If any output of these two commands is incorrect, use the command
          given earlier on this page to set <code class="envar">$LFS</code>
          to the correct directory name and set umask to <code class=
          "literal">022</code>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="admon note">
        <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
        <h3>
          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          One way to ensure that the <code class="envar">LFS</code> variable
          and the umask are always set properly is to edit the <code class=
          "filename">.bash_profile</code> file in both your personal home
          directory and in <code class="filename">/root/.bash_profile</code>
          and enter the <span class="command"><strong>export</strong></span>
          and <span class="command"><strong>umask</strong></span> commands
          above. In addition, the shell specified in the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/passwd</code> file for all users that need the
          <code class="envar">LFS</code> variable must be bash to ensure that
          the <code class="filename">.bash_profile</code> file is
          incorporated as a part of the login process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another consideration is the method that is used to log into the
          host system. If logging in through a graphical display manager, the
          user's <code class="filename">.bash_profile</code> is not normally
          used when a virtual terminal is started. In this case, add the
          commands to the <code class="filename">.bashrc</code> file for the
          user and <code class="systemitem">root</code>. In addition, some
          distributions use an "if" test, and do not run the remaining
          <code class="filename">.bashrc</code> instructions for a
          non-interactive bash invocation. Be sure to place the commands
          ahead of the test for non-interactive use.
