  <title>Setting the $LFS Variable and the Umask</title>

  <para>Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>LFS</envar> will
  be used several times. You should ensure that this variable is always defined
  throughout the LFS build process. It should be set to the name of the
  directory where you will be building your LFS system - we will use
  <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename> as an example, but you may
  choose any directory name you want. If you are building LFS on a separate
  partition, this directory will be the mount point for the partition.
  Choose a directory location and set the variable with the
  following command:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>export LFS=<replaceable>/mnt/lfs</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Having this variable set is beneficial in that commands such as
  <command>mkdir -v $LFS/tools</command> can be typed literally. The shell
  will automatically replace <quote>$LFS</quote> with
  <quote>/mnt/lfs</quote> (or whatever value the variable was set to) when it
  processes the command line.</para>

  <para>Now set the file mode creation mask (umask) to
  <literal>022</literal> in case the host distro uses a different
  default:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>umask 022</userinput></screen>

  <para>Setting the umask to 022 ensures that newly created files and
  directories are only writable by their owner, but are readable and
  searchable (only for directories) by anyone (assuming default modes are
  used by the <ulink role='man' url='&man;open.2'>open(2)</ulink> system
  call, new files will end up with permission mode 644 and directories with
  mode 755).  An overly-permissive default can leave security holes in the
  LFS system, and an overly-restrictive default can cause strange issues
  building or using the LFS system.</para>

  <caution>
  <para>Do not forget to check that <envar>LFS</envar> is set and the
  umask is set to <literal>022</literal> whenever
  you leave and reenter the current working environment (such as when doing a
  <command>su</command> to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> or
  another user). Check that the <envar>LFS</envar> variable is set up
  properly with:</para>

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>echo $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Make sure the output shows the path to your LFS system's build
  location, which is <filename class="directory">/mnt/lfs</filename> if the
  provided example was followed.</para>

  <para>Check that the umask is set up properly with:</para>

  <screen role="nodump"><userinput>umask</userinput></screen>

  <para>The output may be <computeroutput>0022</computeroutput> or
  <computeroutput>022</computeroutput> (the number of leading zeros depends
  on the host distro).</para>

  <para>If any output of these two commands is incorrect, use the command
  given earlier on this page to set <envar>$LFS</envar> to the correct
  directory name and set umask to <literal>022</literal>.</para></caution>

  <note><para>One way to ensure that the <envar>LFS</envar> variable and the
  umask are always set properly is to edit the
  <filename>.bash_profile</filename> file in both your personal home
  directory and in  <filename>/root/.bash_profile</filename> and
  enter the <command>export</command> and <command>umask</command> commands
  above.  In addition, the shell specified in the
  <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file for all users that need the
  <envar>LFS</envar> variable must be bash to ensure that the
  <filename>.bash_profile</filename> file is incorporated as a part of
  the login process.</para>

  <para>Another consideration is the method that is used to log into the
  host system.  If logging in through a graphical display manager, the
  user's <filename>.bash_profile</filename> is not normally used when
  a virtual terminal is started.  In this case, add the commands to
  the <filename>.bashrc</filename> file for the user and
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.  In addition,
  some distributions use an "if" test, and do not run the remaining <filename>.bashrc</filename>
  instructions for a non-interactive bash invocation.  Be sure to place the
  commands ahead of the test for non-interactive use.</para>
